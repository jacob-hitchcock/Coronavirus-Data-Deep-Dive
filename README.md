# Final Project Brainstorm
### Domain of Interest: COVID-19

__Why are we interested in this field?__
- COVID is an ongoing and serious public health issue we are facing right now
- It has already claimed 1.32 million deaths world wide
- 54.3 million confirmed cases world wide
- It is a rapidly changing set of data
- We could help to prevent more infections by finding out the newest cases in Seattle including which district the case came from

[The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32064853/)

This study that extracted data from every reported COVID case in China. Their goal was to examine the impact of the virus on different demographics and what lead to its quick spread.

[Coronavirus disease 2019: What we know?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25766)

This project explored the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID‚Äê19. The group also explored the epidemiology and pathology of COVID.

__Potential data-driven Questions__
- Which country(s) are increasing most rapidly with their number of cases as of Dec 2020?
  - Data regarding the positive test rate by country could be used to answer this
- How has COVID 19 contributed against globalization?
  - Use data surrounding the different impacts COVID has on travel and the economy, as well as people's recorded perceptions of different countries and their response to the outbreak
- Which nations are decreasing their number of cases and what had they done to achieve that?
  - Figures describing the total number of cases, positive test rate, and cases per capita
- Are the speed of developing vaccines relevant to cases in a country?
  - Look at the number of cases a country has and perhaps the amount of money their putting into developing a vaccine.

### Finding data
1. [COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University](https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university)
  - Data is collected by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
  - The data includes confirmed cases and deaths on a country level, confirmed cases and deaths by US county, some metadata that's available in the raw JHU data in multiple CSV files to the number of rows and columns vary
  - We can use this to answer the questions involving increasing or decreasing cases, and parts of the vaccine question.
2. [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data)
  - Data is collected by a volunteer organization from *The Atlantic* and imports data directly from each state's COVID reporting systems.
  - 18 Data columns and the rows are dates from 1/22/20 to 11/15/20
  - This data can be used to answer our first, second, and fourth question
3. [Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
  - Compiled data by the *NY Times* and collected by the local and federal governments.
  - Again, this is a collection of CSV files surrounding deaths, number of cases, a variety of locations, and even data on mask wearing so number of rows and columns vary.
  - This data could help us to answer parts of all of our questions.
